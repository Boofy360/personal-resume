                <strong>Hello! I'm Joshua. I am based in Brighton in the United Kingdom and I love taking on new challenges that broaden my palette of skills and knowledge.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the past few years I have been working in the insurance sector within private healthcare and more recently for a reputable private health insurer. During this time I have gathered the experience required to operate effectively and efficiently within
                this ever changing sector whilst simultaneously pioneering and improving processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also currently studying with the Code Institute to become a full stack web developer. So far I have practiced in multiple technologies including HTML, CSS and Javascript and it's a course that I hope will ultimately transform into a career.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not behind a desk as a hobby I like to play the guitar. However, I'm interested in many genres of music - I could go from listening to heavy metal to hip hop in one sitting so my Spotify profile looks quite diverse in that sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have a keen interest in gaming, I grew up on console and PC gaming from an early age and there was always competition with my older brothers as to who could be the best. Needless to say at an earlier age I was left losing for the most part but it has
                always been a past time for me.
            </p>
            <p>
